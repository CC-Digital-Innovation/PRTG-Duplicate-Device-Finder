# PRTG-Duplicate-Device-Finder

## Summary
This script looks at devices in a PRTG instance and detects if a
device's name or IPv4 address appears more than once for a probe. It
then prints its results to the console.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
Provides insight to inconsistencies in a PRTG instance so that they may be
exposed and corrected to maintain the cleanliness of the PRTG instance.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.5
- configparser >= 5.0.2
- requests >= 2.25.1

## Usage
- Add any additional filtering logic to the API URLs to get specific
  devices if desired.
    - _Make sure you configure filtering options accordingly. Available
      options for filtering can be found on the PRTG API:
      https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/live_multiple_object_property_status#advanced_filtering_

- Add additional device properties to make records include more information
  about a device.

- Edit the config.ini file with relevant PRTG access information.

- Simply run the script using Python:
  `python PRTG-Duplicate-Device-Finder.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.5.
